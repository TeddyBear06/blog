title: R u kidding MS?
---

Maybe you've already seen the MS Windows 11 craziness about hardware requirements, maybe not. 

Anyway, Windows 10 won't get support after 14/10/2025. So what to do next? 

Switch to the brand new - free (not really) - Windows 11 whatsoever? Maybe. 

But what about this crazy hardware requirement... 

[TPM 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module)? This imply that everything before an 8th Gen Intel Core and AMD Ryzen 2000 just wonâ€™t work... 

Ok, a clever guy found a way to install W11 (by copying `install.wim` from a bootable W11 to a bootable W10 image (BTW WTF??)) even if a computer do not meet this requirement (until the next MS update). But in the end, do we/you/me/us expect that from an operating system right now?

The main response/argument from MS is security. Security is everywhere, I mean the security argument is everywhere, but at the end, what's the real meanning of security? Is security is at cost of technology waste?

Masses creates business around computing ecosytem. There are more ransomware everywhere (maybe less creative than - ever - before, that's the reason why they are - so - visible), our life rely more and more and private companies that don't really care about our digital assets. Ok but at the end, it's a wicked game.

Do not - ever - think that you can beat the unbeatable.

Do not think that by adding more obscurity around your stuff you'll avoid script kiddies.

It has never worked like that.

At the begining, there were no passwords. You know why, because if there is no passwords, there is nothing to "hack". 

If a data is properly encrypted, there is no way (ok I'm kidding) to get a clear version of this data. If you do not connect your dummy server to a public internet connection, there is no way to be fu**ed up (ok I'm nearly kidding).

What I mean here is that, guys, folks, whatsoever, just use your brain.

You dig your own grave.

If there is no change about MS position, I'll leave MS for the good.

P.S: Will MS censor my writings since they own GitHub... Maybe, maybe not.
